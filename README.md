# TIC-TAC-TOE-MINIMAX
The project involves the creation of a Python program that allows users to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. The program incorporates the minimax algorithm to provide an intelligent and challenging opponent. 

#Technical details: 
The program utilizes a list-based board representation, with each position being represented by a character ('X' or 'O'). Functions like insertLetter and printBoard handle the board manipulation and display. The minimax algorithm is employed in the compMove function to make intelligent decisions for the computer player, considering winning possibilities and blocking the opponent. The code also includes error handling for invalid moves and checks for a full board to determine a tie.
